fix(scenarioEngine): resolve RAF scheduler freeze and event listener accumulation on reload

Two separate bugs caused ScenarioEngine UI to freeze after page reloads:

1. RAF Scheduler Flag Persistence (StrictMode)
   - isScheduledRef.current persisted across unmount/remount while RAF was cancelled
   - Messages arrived on remount and saw stale 'true' flag, skipping new RAF
   - Fixed by resetting flag in useLayoutEffect cleanup (runs BEFORE remount)

2. Event Listener Accumulation
   - New event listeners added on each reload, causing CPU spike by 3rd reload
   - Fixed by making DotBot subscription idempotent
   - Removed DotBot unsubscribe from hook cleanup (App component manages lifecycle)

Changes:
- ScenarioEngineContext: Reset scheduler flag in useLayoutEffect cleanup
- ScenarioEngine: Made subscribeToDotBot idempotent, added listener count warning
- useScenarioEngine: Removed DotBot unsubscribe from cleanup
- Removed excessive debug logging throughout

Tested in Chromium with 5+ reloads - scenarios run smoothly every time.
Note: Firefox still has issues (different underlying cause, marked as low-impact).

Files changed:
- frontend/src/components/scenarioEngine/context/ScenarioEngineContext.tsx
- lib/dotbot-core/scenarioEngine/ScenarioEngine.ts
- frontend/src/components/scenarioEngine/hooks/useScenarioEngine.ts

Known remaining issues:
- Firefox-specific freeze (requires separate investigation)
- ScenarioEngine only works in already-started conversations
